Paddy O'Connell and guests including historian Dominic Sandbrook, Alvin Hall, Ann Treneman and Naomi Shragai will reflect on the personalities and stories of 70s America - from Nixon's resignation, Muhammad Ali to Vietnam and women's lib. 

The Letter from America programmes featured were taped by two listeners and stored in a cellar, an attic and a fertiliser spreader for nearly 40 years. They were recorded by a dairy farmer from the Cotswolds, and a man from Cornwall, who between them have provided the BBC with over 650 lost Letter from America programmes from the 1970s and 1980s. 

Music chosen:

Alvin Hall - Stevie Wonder, Sir Duke 
Ann Treneman - Bob Dylan, Forever Young 
David Henderson - Don Mclean, Colour TV Blues 
Naomi Shragai - Bruce Springsteen, Born to Run.
